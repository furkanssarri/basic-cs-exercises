## a basic linked-lists practice

a simple practice to perform general manipulations on linked lists.

### the practice aims to achieve:

- creating a linked list class,
- creating a node class and
- implement the following methods:
   - append,
   - prepend,
   - size (number of nodes in the list),
   - get head,
   - get tail,
   - get the indexAt,
   - pop the last node from the list,
   - contains (value) returning bool,
   - find (the index of a given value),
   - toString to stringify the current list in e.g:  "( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null" format,
   - insertAt insert node at index,
   - removeAt remove node at index,
