## a basic hash-maps practice

a simple practice to perform general manipulations on hash maps data structure.

### the practice aims to achieve:

- creating a HashMap class and
- implement the following methods:
   - initiate / create buckets,
   - hash,
   - iterate over buckets,
   - iterate over entries (if any),
   - all 4 CRUD operations,
   - clear all,
   - get legth,
   - search (key),
   - return existing keys (in an array),
   - return existing values (in an array),
   - return entries (in an array),
   - dynamically check capacity and current load,
   - resize once 0.75 load factor is reached,
   - rehash everything after resizing,
